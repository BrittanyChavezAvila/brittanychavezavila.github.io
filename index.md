### CPSC 120

* Lab 7

  ========

    One of my favorite labs was Lab 7, Part 1, because the concept and goal were similar to Lab 4, Part 1. The goal was to calculate the date difference with functions. This lab required you to work with functions and call them back into the main function. It made the code cleaner because the math was previously done in functions that were later called. It simplified things and taught me how to work with functions for the first time.

* Lab 10

  ========

    One of my favorites was Lab 10, Part 3 because it was the first time I coded an image or animation. It's fascinating to see how math is used in the animation process; in this lab, the goal was to create a gradient. This lab assisted me in establishing a foundation with image and animation coding, and I can't wait to apply what I've learned to future projects.

* Lab 11

  ========

    Lab 11, Part 2 was among my favorites because the source code was visually appealing. I liked how functions were created and declared in a separate source file. This made it simple to call the functions in the .cc file and to understand and trace the code. Not only did I enjoy the way this lab taught us to code, but I also enjoyed the Hi-Low Game concept.
